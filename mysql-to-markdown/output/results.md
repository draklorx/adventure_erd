# Garden of Stone

**Description**

Rumours tell of an abandoned estate where statues move and flowers sparkle with crystal dust. Brave souls are needed to end the strange curse.

**Adventure Details (spoilers)**

Decades ago, an eccentric noble installed a magical prism in his greenhouse. The prism now petrifies the grounds, animates stonework, and twists plants into predators.              
The heroes must push past the shattered courtyard, navigate a maze of glass and greenery, and finally shatter the Heartstone Prism in the central conservatory.  
Three key locations tie the story together:  (1) the Courtyard, where the first signs of animation appear; (2) the Crystal Greenhouse, alive with hostile flora; and (3)               
the Prism Chamber itself, guarded by basilisk spawn and living statuary.

## Shattered Courtyard

Crumbling walls ring a once‑graceful courtyard now overrun with ivy. Jagged marble fragments crunch underfoot, and wind whistles through broken archways. 
Statues lean at odd angles as if frozen mid‑flight; some genuinely are. The courtyard introduces the creeping curse and hints at hidden passages leading to the inner gardens.

#### A. Overgrown Gate

---
*A rust‑bitten portcullis hangs half‑open beneath a collapsed arch. Moonlight glints on the tangled **Iron Gate**, while nettles mask a **Hidden Hatch** sunken into flagstones.*

---
**Iron Gate**

A clotted mass of vines seals the bars. Brute force or cleaving the growth frees the gateway.

Strength (Athletics) DC15: With a heave, characters wrench the portcullis high enough to slip through.

**Hidden Hatch**

A half‑rotted wooden panel conceals a ladder into servants’ tunnels.

Intelligence (Investigation) DC13: Noticing a draft reveals the hatch outline; opening it grants an alternate route.

#### B. Broken Fountain Plaza

---
*Water no longer flows, yet a cracked bowl still dominates the square. Two winged shapes crouch atop the rim – the **Gargoyle Perch** – and a dark grate yawns at the base, leading to a **Mosaic Drain**.*

---
**Gargoyle Perch**

Stone sentinels spring to life, clawing at intruders from their lofty rim.

**Mosaic Drain**

Broken tiles hide a rusted grate leading to channels beneath the fountain.

Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) DC14: Popping the grate uncovers a crawlspace toward the greenhouse.

#### C. Statue Walk

---
*Marble effigies line a cracked path. One, the **Cracked Statue**, seems freshly shattered; beside it lies a dusty **Petrified Backpack** still clasped by stone fingers.*

---
**Cracked Statue**

A hollow statue hides a lurking predator, its marble shell ready to shatter further.

**Petrified Backpack**

Stone‑locked leather holds journals describing an arcane prism amplifying basilisk gazes.

Intelligence (Arcana) DC12: Deciphering notes gives clues to neutralising the prism.

## Crystal Greenhouse

A cathedral of glass and wrought iron whose panes cast kaleidoscopic rainbows across tangled vines. Heat, mist, and the scent of wet earth fill the air. 
Strange orchids glow from within, while deeper inside a prism pulses with sinister light, warping flora and fauna alike. This is the adventure’s climax and source of the petrifying magic.

#### A. Steaming Orchid Rows

---
*Glass shards crunch as you enter rows of towering, mist‑wreathed stalks. A hulking **Awakened Tree** groans as roots crack tiles, and clusters of **Glowing Orchids** pulse with eerie light.*

---
**Awakened Tree**

Roots rip floor tiles while thorny limbs lash out.

**Glowing Orchids**

Phosphorescent blooms emit faint anti‑petrification spores when carefully harvested.

Wisdom (Nature) DC13: Correct handling yields petals that grant advantage on next save vs. petrification.

#### B. Reflecting Pool

---
*A rectangular basin mirrors the shattered ceiling in its still surface. The water shimmers – the **Silver Waters** – while a faint outline beneath hints at a **Submerged Lever**.*

---
**Silver Waters**

Magically infused water mirrors illusions; decoding symbols on its surface reveals hidden mechanisms.

Intelligence (Arcana) DC15: Interpreting runes shows how to drain the pool.

**Submerged Lever**

A corroded handle lies just beyond reach under freezing water.

Strength (Athletics) DC14: Hauling the lever down empties the pool and unlocks a shortcut tunnel.

#### C. Heartstone Chamber

---
*In the domed heart of the greenhouse floats the faceted **Heartstone Prism**, bathing vines in kaleidoscopic light. Coiled nearby, eyes gleaming with the same hues, waits a **Guardian Basilisk**.*

---
**Heartstone Prism**

A multifaceted crystal rotating in mid‑air, humming with magical energy. Striking true fractures it; shattering ends the curse.

Intelligence (Arcana) DC17: Finding the right resonance lets heroes weaken the prism before it explodes.

**Guardian Basilisk**

A prism‑infused basilisk whose scales refract rainbow light, doubling its lethal gaze.
