You are an expert dungeon master and creative adventure writer who also happens to be good at organizing your adventures in a SQL database. Choose a challenge rating for the adventure between 1 and 5.

Create a series of insert statements to create a new adventure. The adventure should have a theme to it and locations, encounters, monsters, etc. should fit the theme.

Make sure you include data for every column unless otherwise noted.

The spoiler_free_description should include a brief summary of the adventure and the goals of the players. The spoiler_description should include the player's goal in this adventure, along with the overarching story, and how the differente locations/encounters play into it. Set the number_of_players and level to blank for now. The adventure should have between 2 and 3 locations.

Do not worry about a map_url for a location and leave that blank for now. Assume each map will be 1000 x 1000. The description should be an overall description of that location. Each location should have between 3 and 5 encounters. 

Each encounter within a location should have a sort_order starting at 1 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent encounter in the location. The map_marker_symbol should be a single uppercase letter in alphabetical order and correspond to the sort_order, ie. 1=A, 2=B, and so on. Choose a random number from 1 to 1,000 for its map_marker_x and map_marker_y values. The read_aloud text should reference the names of each PointOfInterest within the encounter. Furthermore the read_aloud text should be an evocative nerrative describing sights, sounds, and smells. Leave the summary blank for now.

Each PointOfInterest should have a name which should be referenced by the read_aloud_text in the encounter this PointOfInterest is associated with. The description should give more details about what is happening at this point of interest. The sort_order should start with 1 and increment by 1 for each additional point of interest within that encounter. Each point of interest should have between 1 and 3 of some combination of PointOfInterestAbilityChecks, and PointOfInterestMonsters. 

Each PointOfInterestAbilityCheck should include an ability which represents a skill to check against. The difficulty should be between 5 and 25 where  5 is trivial, 10 is easy, 15 is medium, 20 is difficult, and 25 is nearly impossible. Difficulties less than 10 or above 20 should be very rare! The description should indicate what happens if the player succeeds the check.

The PointOfInterestMonster represents 1 or more monsters within this encounter. The monster_id should reference the index in the attached 5e-SRD-Monsters-Simplified json file. When selecting monsters, all monsters within the adventure should be within 1 challenge rating of each other and all monsters within an encounter should be of the same type. Number represents how many of that monster should appear and should typically be 1-3. The custom_name should be used for single monsters with a specific proper name, or a group of monsters to further describe what kind of monster they are.

PointOfInterestMonster and PointOfInterestAbilityCheck each reference a point_of_interest_id and their sort order should also start with 1 but be combined per point_of_interest_id. In example, if a point of interest has 1 monster and 2 ability checks then the sort_order might be 1 for the monster, 2 for the first ability check, and 3 for the second ability check.
